Our cases often present thorny and novel legal issues. Many involve challenging questions of state and federal constitutional and statutory law. Below is a sample of matters:
On behalf of a county, we recently defended an industry challenge to a citizen initiative that presented questions of void for vagueness, federal preemption and other issues.
On behalf of a hospital dedicated to care for the indigent, we are suing a retirement system for systematically overcharging to the detriment of the hospital’s mission in violation of state constitutional duties.
On behalf of a public skilled nursing facility, we defended claims in state court of whistleblower retaliation arising out of the facility’s efforts to improve services to its residents and obtained a complete defense verdict.
On behalf of various public entities, we are litigating cutting edge issues regarding application of the state and federal contracts clauses, including a case pending in the California Supreme Court.
We have joined with other attorneys to sue opioid manufacturers and large technology companies over their corporate practices.

Testimonials
""After graduating college, I grew a print marketing company that had over 65 employees. In 2012, after 26 years, I sold my company and decided to get back to my passion which was finance. It was a pretty natural transition from where I was with the printing company to building my business with Equitable Advisors. I called on the clients I had built relationships with over the past 26 years and told them about what I was doing now. I love being able to meet with business owners, really understand what they're going through and help offer financial solutions.""
-Jim Altebrando, Financial Professional
""Prior to becoming a Financial Professional, I was a teacher. I enjoyed it, but there was a lack of fulfillment and I was looking for something more. What I love most about this career is that it allows me the flexibility to be a mother and a wife to my family first. Secondly, I get such a thrill knowing that I've been able to help someone with their financial future.""
-Arrkeenah Willis, Financial Professional
""I always knew I wanted to get into finance so after college, I started interviewing at about a dozen different firms and chose to join Equitable Advisors. Starting out, it was a challenge, but about six months in, I started getting referrals and could really see the value I was bringing to clients. Since then my business has steadily increased.""

Why You Might Be Excited About Us:
Like us, you believe that beauty has the power to elevate and transform, and you’re excited about our mission to help everyone feel great in their own skin.
Like us, you enjoy serving others, and you find caring for patients more energizing and fulfilling than stressful. You genuinely enjoy supporting others through very personal and intimate journeys.
Like us, you enjoy driving new prospects and making direct contributions to the company’s success and mission.
Like us, you crave the idea of “owning a number” and having objective proof of your value to the team
Like us, you have a hunger to making raving fans out of every patient whose life you have the opportunity to touch.
Why You Might NOT Be Excited About Us:
We’re a small business (<10 people), so if you like more hierarchy and levels of management in a bigger company, this role isn’t for you.
We serve patients. Patients can be demanding, needy, afraid, even upset or unreasonable. You need to enjoy helping people from all walks of life and in all sorts of emotional states, so if you are not a compassionate or empathetic person, this probably isn’t the job for you.
We deal with beauty and healing, but also potential pain and suffering, so the stakes are high. You need to committed to seeing the details through for every patient, every time. If you are not detail oriented, this probably isn’t the job for you.
We don’t have it all figured out. As a bootstrapped, family owned, small business, there are many areas of the company where we’re still “building the rocket on the way up.” So, if you require a tested and proven playbook to perform every aspect of your job, then this probably isn’t the place for you.
We work really, really hard. Everyone on the team is extremely mission-driven, and works incredibly hard to achieve our “comfortably-uncomfortable” goals. While we DON’T believe in working weekends or pulling “alnighters” as a normal course of business, if you want a cushy, 40-hour per week job, you probably won’t like it here.
We change our minds, pivot fast, and embrace change when change is needed. We aren’t flakes, nor do we seek chaos for chaos’s sake. But we WILL shift projects and priorities when presented with new data, so, again, if you need to work at a company that “has it all figured out,” we’re not the place for you.
We don’t micro-manage. This is not the kind of job where you show up and we tell you exactly what to do every day. We need people who can manage their own calendar and who aren’t afraid to Google something if they don’t know how to do it. In other words, if you need to know EXACTLY what you will be doing every hour of the day, week over week, we’re probably not a good fit.

There is potential for growth for the right candidate
Why You Might Be Excited About Us:
Like us, you believe that beauty has the power to elevate and transform, and you’re excited about our mission to help everyone feel great in their own skin.
Like us, you enjoy serving others, and you find caring for patients more energizing and fulfilling than stressful. You genuinely enjoy supporting others through very personal and intimate journeys.
Like us, you enjoy driving new prospects and making direct contributions to the company’s success and mission.
Like us, you crave the idea of “owning a number” and having objective proof of your value to the team
Like us, you have a hunger to making raving fans out of every patient whose life you have the opportunity to touch.
Why You Might NOT Be Excited About Us:
We’re a small business (<10 people), so if you like more hierarchy and levels of management in a bigger company, this role isn’t for you.
We serve patients. Patients can be demanding, needy, afraid, even upset or unreasonable. You need to enjoy helping people from all walks of life and in all sorts of emotional states, so if you are not a compassionate or empathetic person, this probably isn’t the job for you.
We deal with beauty and healing, but also potential pain and suffering, so the stakes are high. You need to committed to seeing the details through for every patient, every time. If you are not detail oriented, this isn’t the job for you.
We don’t have it all figured out. As a bootstrapped, family owned, small business, there are many areas of the company where we’re still “building the rocket on the way up.” So, if you require a tested and proven playbook to perform every aspect of your job, then this probably isn’t the place for you.
We work really, really hard. Everyone on the team is extremely mission-driven, and works incredibly hard to achieve our “comfortably-uncomfortable” goals. While we DON’T believe in working weekends or pulling “all-nighters” as a normal course of business, if you want a cushy, 40-hour per week job, you probably won’t like it here.
We change our minds, pivot fast, and embrace change when change is needed. We aren’t flakes, nor do we seek chaos for chaos’s sake. But we WILL shift projects and priorities when presented with new data, so, again, if you need to work at a company that “has it all figured out,” we’re not the place for you.
We don’t micro-manage. This is not the kind of job where you show up and we tell you exactly what to do every day. We need people who can manage their own calendar and who aren’t afraid to Google something if they don’t know how to do it. In other words, if you need to know EXACTLY what you will be doing every hour of the day, week over week, we’re probably not a good fit.
Your Next Steps...
If this sounds like your kind of position, then you're our kind of 77 Plastic Surgery Patient Counselor and Front Office Coordinator! Take two minutes to apply below.
We are consistently hiring as our company scales, so apply now as we believe in taking fast action and will give preference to those who take ownership of showing us why they should join our world-class team.

THIS IS A CITYWIDE EXAM. San Francisco is a vibrant and dynamic city, on the forefront of economic growth & innovation, urban development, arts & entertainment, as well as social issues & change. This rich tapestry of culture and ideas is sustained by our City's commitment to heighten the quality of life for the diverse population of San Franciscans and residents of the greater Bay Area. Our employees play an important role not only in making our City what it is today, but also in shaping the future of San Francisco.
Our Office
The Office of the Assessor-Recorder is responsible for fairly and accurately executing property assessment functions in accordance with the State Constitution and State and local laws. Our core responsibilities include identifying all taxable property in the City and County of San Francisco, establishing a taxable value, and applying all legal exemptions. Property broadly includes real property as well as personal property owned by businesses.
The Office is also responsible for recording documents and securing public records. We ensure each document meets recording requirements and make them accessible to the public. We record over 400 different types of documents annually, including deeds of trust, reconveyances, liens, maps, and public marriage certificates.
Additionally, the Office is responsible for collecting any transfer tax due upon a change in property ownership. We perform audits to ensure the correct property value basis for taxation.
In all that we do we seek to advance the values of fairness, care, equity, and excellence in service to our diverse constituents and communities.
What We Do
We’re proud of our work to ensure the financial stability of San Francisco. Each year we prepare an assessment roll that reflects the taxable values of land, improvements, and personal property. The assessment roll is the basis for
San Francisco’s property tax revenue. We enroll property tax value by discovering new construction or changes in ownership. The work of our Office in enrolling property valued at $344 billion generates $4 billion in property tax revenue for the City and County of San Francisco. Property tax revenue represents over one-third of the City's General Fund which pays for crucial services ranging from public safety, affordable housing, and education to neighborhood improvements and health and family support services. In the years ahead, our Office will work closely with the Assessment Appeals Board to respond to the rising appeals workload and ensure that fair and accurate value is enrolled.
Our success is grounded by our Office's investment in our people, systems, services, and engagement. We prioritize a climate and culture where belonging and inclusion are advanced, staff can be their authentic selves and pursue pathways for career growth, and diverse constituencies are equitably supported with a meaningful and seamless experience through care in customer service and efficient technology systems. In line with these values, we are taking significant steps to modernize our operations, including leading a cross-departmental effort to replace the legacy property assessment system currently used to manage the City’s hundreds of billions of dollars in assessed property value. Known as SMART (System for Managing Assessment, Recording, and Transactions), this work will provide for increased 2esecurity and service as well as greater integration with other City systems utilized by the Office of the Treasurer & Tax Collector and the City Controller’s Office. We are committed to developing an organization that can address the pervasive and persistent inequities enabled by biases and systemic functions that impede racial and economic justice and prevent equitable service to the public. Additionally, our Office seeks to increase access to resources across multiple constituencies by hosting presentations, workshops, attending events, tabling at resource fairs, and more to ensure that all San Franciscans know what our office can do for them.

A passing score on the Written Multiple-Choice Examination must be achieved in order to be placed on the Eligible List.
Score Banking: Scores attained on the Assessor-Recorder Office Assistant Exam will be 'banked' for three years, starting from the date of the examination. This means that, during this three-year time period, candidates need not take this test again.

Re-testing is permitted no sooner than one year from the date of the test and only in association with a candidate’s eligibility for another announcement to which the candidate has applied and is deemed qualified. If a candidate opts to re-test, the re-test score becomes the candidate’s official score since it is the most recent.
If a significant modification is made to this exam in the future, the application of “banked” scores may no longer be appropriate. In such a rare circumstance, candidates with “banked” scores would be required to re-take the exam sooner than the three-year period specified above should they apply to another job opportunity where the modified exam is used.

Who We Are
Great strides have been made over the past few years in promoting criminal justice reforms that recognize that prior “tough on crime” and incarceration-driven practices don’t always produce safer or healthier communities. New thinking has started to permeate the justice system and has prompted proactive and prevention-oriented strategies.
Against that backdrop, a new generation of reform-minded state and local elected prosecutors committed to changing their office culture and promoting a less punitive approach to addressing crime has come into office. Recently elected DAs in geographic areas ranging from Los Angeles, St. Louis, and Philadelphia to smaller rural communities are pushing back against the “law and order/tough on crime” rhetoric of past decades and elevating a national conversation around the importance of a fair, equitable and right-sized justice system.
FJP brings together these reform-minded and innovative elected prosecutors as part of a network of leaders committed to promoting a justice system grounded in fairness, equity, compassion, and fiscal responsibility.
If you do not see a job that suits you, please feel free to upload your resume any way and we will stay in touch about opportunities we have.

LawHQ is a national, plaintiff-side class action firm focused on eradicating telephone spam. We are looking to hire a skilled and motivated attorney to contribute in all phases of our litigation. The successful candidate will be an eager and passionate advocate looking for the right opportunity to showcase (and further develop) their talents.
Candidates must have the following characteristics to be considered for this remote position:
Exceptional dedication to excellence
Ironclad work ethic
Driven to succeed
Meticulous and persuasive writer
In-depth legal researcher
Effective communication skills
Can-do attitude
The most desirable candidates will also have experience in federal court with class actions.
This position requires an average of 50 hours of work per week.
INTRODUCING LawHQ
LawHQ is a law firm unlike any other. And we LOVE what we do—tracking down and suing telephone spammers.
How does LawHQ hunt down these spammers? We’ve developed and invested substantially into our own proprietary technology that enables us to track down virtually every telephone spammer. We have created an iOS and Android app that allows users—right from their phones—to swipe left to report calls, text messages, and voicemails as spam. The reported spam is relayed to a custom-built back office for review by our investigators, paralegals, and attorneys. Thousands of users report spam through our app, and LawHQ already knows the spammers behind much of the reported SMS spam.
Simply put, with thousands of potential clients, and hundreds of known spammers/potential defendants, LawHQ already enjoys a luxury to which most firms can only aspire: the ability to be highly-selective in pursuing our largest class actions, while employing alternative strategies to achieve meaningful results for countless other clients.
As we pursue these cases, and initiate many more, we expect to reduce telephone spam substantially in the coming years. We have the tools and expertise to do that, but need talented and driven attorneys to join the team in handling our ever-growing caseload.
Founded in 2019, our firm has blossomed without losing its strong sense of purpose and cohesion. And we are well-positioned for greater expansion; over the next 12-18 months, we anticipate significant growth across our divisions. Above all else, however, we remain fiercely committed to our core mission of superlative client service delivered by dedicated and passionate advocates.
How can I learn more about LawHQ?
Thomas Alvord—the founder and CEO of LawHQ—has recorded an introductory video for this specific job posting, available here:
https://youtu.be/inPOEOLnybU
We also invite you to browse lawhq.com, and to search Google and federal court dockets to learn more about our practice.
Whom does LawHQ hire? We are building an A+ team. At LawHQ, this is no mere platitude: our attorneys embrace the opportunity to take primary responsibility for lawsuits involving tens of millions of dollars in damages. We expect a high quality and high quantity of work product; our attorneys typically work at least 40 hours per week. You should expect an unusually-broad range of professional opportunities early and often, and colleagues who genuinely care about your happiness, growth, and success.
We are looking for people who are driven to learn and to innovate; people who aim to excel in class actions, mass actions, and the Telephone Consumer Protection Act; people who understand the value of teamwork and the importance of communication.
Our goal is to work with attorneys who aspire to remain with LawHQ for the mid- to long-term, no less than five to ten years.
OVERVIEW OF WORKING CONDITIONS
This is a fully-remote position (typically from a person’s own appropriately designated office space, whether at home or elsewhere), but may require occasional travel to court or to LawHQ's yearly company retreat.
While our attorneys enjoy the freedom to work flexible hours and take time off as needed, deadlines must be met, and the demands of the job must be prioritized and accomplished timely and at a high standard. The successful candidate also will be expected to attend regular company-wide and legal team meetings, and other periodic meetings.
The successful candidate will be expected to work well independently, as well as in a team setting. The successful candidate will report to one or more senior attorneys, and will work with at least one paralegal.

Taking consumer-side litigation from initial vetting to trial or class-wide resolution
Investigating potential cases and legal issues

Actively developing a deep knowledge and understanding of all the facts in each case
Researching relevant facts, case law, and regulations for new cases
Reviewing, analyzing, and summarizing evidence

Drafting discovery, and preparing for and taking/defending depositions
Preparing for, and participating in, hearings and trials
Identifying, selecting, and working with expert witnesses
Benefits
The successful candidate will be an exempt, at-will employee of LawHQ. The starting base salary will be between $120,000 - $160,000 plus immediate eligibility for a share of settlements/awards.
LawHQ offers medical benefits and a 401(k) plan. We also offer flexible work hours, and the ability to work from home or any appropriate location.

All across the world, from the azure pools of Turkey and Oman to the travertine terraces of Yellowstone, our planet quietly pulls carbon dioxide from the air and turns it to stone. For eons, Earth has relied on this process to balance its carbon cycle. What if it could be harnessed? What if we could do it faster, in larger quantities, and at a low enough cost to make it an effective tool in the fight against climate change?

At Heirloom, we are turning that into reality. We use the natural carbon capture properties of abundant minerals to pull CO2 from the air, and store it permanently underground. We come to work every day to slow climate change, and are united behind a single, common goal - to remove 1 billion tons of CO2 from the sky by 2035, and to not stop before we get there.

We bring together the precise recipe of science, technology, know-how, and strategy necessary to make low cost, high quality carbon removal a reality. If we’re successful, we will directly mitigate climate change, build a world we can proudly hand over to our children and grandchildren, and catalyze an industry that will rival the largest the world has ever seen. If you want to change the planet, come join us.

Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
As temperatures continue to rise, individuals from marginalized communities will face the harshest impacts of climate change. We believe wholeheartedly that building a diverse company is critical to Heirloom’s success. To accomplish this, we’ve put recruiting, hiring and retaining individuals from underrepresented groups at the top of our priority list.

We encourage you to apply if you identify as Black, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, American Indian or Alaskan Native, Hispanic or Latino, LGBTQ+ – or with any other underrepresented group – even if you don’t tick all the boxes in the description below.
Don't see a role that directly fits your skillset? Never fear! Heirloom is always looking for talented and passionate Research Scientists to join our team. Heirloom's Research Science team focuses on discovering and evaluating fundamental and applied science that can be used for removing CO2 directly from the air. If you have expertise in geochemistry, carbonate chemistry, high temperature kinetics, reactor design, complex experimental design, or similar skillsets, we want to hear from you!
Our Principles
Radical Honesty means we are open, transparent, and inclusive in everything we do. We aren't scared to challenge each other, but bring clear motives and our best intentions when we do.
Persistent Optimism means we carry an infinite amount of optimistic energy with us on our journey, constantly chipping away at what may seem insurmountable.
Maximize our learning rate means we're always in discovery mode. Compounding knowledge is our key to victory - we continuously hone our crafts, seek the fastest paths to new learning, and are quick to absorb new knowledge.
Why you should join Heirloom
We are solving the engineering problem of our generation. Climate change is an existential threat, and we need as many of the world’s motivated minds as possible to help. There is no greater challenge or opportunity than fighting climate change.
We have done this before. We’re engineers, scientists, and concerned humans from a variety of backgrounds and experiences who are pooling our knowledge and skills to collectively build a more equitable, prosperous future for all.
We are a united, resilient, and optimistic bunch. We are all here for the same reason - to slow climate change. We recognize the magnitude of the challenge ahead of us, and believe we can solve it. We can see a hopeful future where we eventually reverse climate change. It won’t be easy, but we won’t quit.
We are backed by the best climate partners in the world. We’re well funded by investors from Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Ahren Innovation Capital, Carbon Direct, Microsoft, Lowercarbon Capital, ARPA-e and the National Science Foundation.

Invisible Technologies offers unusual services (a combination of outsourcing and automation) to fast-scaling, innovative companies. Each company understands and uses our services in a variety of ways. It’s critical we can communicate to segments of users with visually appealing, and highly communicative assets. You’re helping us explain the benefits of our product in a way that words alone never could.

Job Description

Please apply in the following link: https://jobs.lever.co/invisible/a934a35d-0b29-4201-a9a6-82ffe5b62a13

Invisible Technologies helps fast-growing companies scale efficiently, so they can improve margins and capture market share at the same time. We partner with our clients to run their business operations using our modern outsourcing platform to deliver efficiency, quality, and flexibility at scale.

We believe that…

Mission. Invisible is a world-changing company and the Operations Team is responsible for creating the systems that will launch Invisible into the stratosphere.
Ownership. Every partner on the team is the “CEO” of their area - each of us are empowered to jump in and solve the problems in front of us.
Communication. Consistent feedback is key - we are addicted to learning and getting better.
Transparency. What one of us knows, all of us should know.
Self-Improvement. Every new mistake is a learning opportunity.
Meritocracy. The value someone produces should be reflected back in the position of responsibility and compensation that they receive.

The Role

The goal of an Operations Analyst (OA) is to unlock efficiencies and quality improvements in our operations through analysis, process design, and project management. OAs are paired with Operations Directors and serve as an extra pair of eyes, ears, hands, and brain — a catalyst for the Director to achieve their department’s overall objectives. Daily responsibilities for an OA vary, but often times include efficiency & quality analyses on process work, financial analyses on different areas of our operations, project management of certain client work, and process design improvement work on important client or internal processes.

The life of an OA is a difficult one, one where a persevering work ethic needs to be paired with an active, creative mind. That said, the OA role is a center for immense learning. Pairing directly with a senior partner and interacting regularly with various facets of the company (from individual agent operators to product managers), OAs will receive a frequent and diverse range of experiences, coaching, and opportunities. Our best OAs go on to become Operations Managers or move on to related roles in other teams at the company.

Who We Want

Operations Analysts (OAs) are very flexible, hybrid partners that have a high growth trajectory and can thrive (with proper coaching) in multiple dimensions. This flexibility is key to continuing our high growth trajectory: we grew over 3x for two consecutive years in a row (2020 & 2021) and plan to do so again in 2022. We are looking for OAs who can harness both the humble trait of being coachable and the ambitious trait of constantly desiring learning. The spirit animal of a junior OA is a sponge. And, over time, they will evolve with more learning, experience, and responsibility.

There are 3 key areas we will focus on growing the skillset of an OA to prepare them for a promotion to Operation Manager: Operations Management, Client Management, & Product Ownership. See job description for Operations Manager for more context on these skills.
Working Times: US (EST or PST) Hours
2022: $60,000 annual OTE (base + bonus) + equity!

About Trackers
We help children feel like that group of kids wandering country backyards 50 years ago: independent, tired, muddy, wet, and happy from the woods and wild. Through our many years in education, we are acutely aware of the real hazards of the outdoors. We work to keep kids safe but not encapsulated from, nor phobic of what is wild. We believe children need to develop ever increasing independence, competency, and capacity in nature—not only for their own connection and fulfillment but also to contribute to their families, future generations, and the more-than-human world. We believe it is okay to be thirsty at times, cold at times, and wet at times. This builds empathy and care for the gifts of life, fostering true adventure and genuine accomplishment. We also believe it is critical for children to feel supported and cared for as they explore their passion for service and responsibility. And through a healthy life found in nature connection, they can test their limits and discover the great potential of the often untapped physical grit and emotional resilience they possess.
Skills We Teach:
Bushcraft Skills Stealth, camouflage, field archery, bushcraft, and wilderness survival.
Mariner Skills Fishing, boating, crawfishing, river running, and navigation.
Farming Skills Farming, folk craft, wild plants, and homesteading.
Strategic Skills Martial arts, paintball, role-playing games, and strategic thinking.
Leadership Skills Leadership & service that incorporates principles of Stoicism from the Hellenistic philosophical tradition.

What does BPM stand for? Innovation, opportunity, community, diversity, inclusivity, flexibility and so much more.
B-P-M stands for “Because People Matter,” because at our core, our people drive everything we do and how we do it.
We are a forward-thinking, full-service accounting firm providing modern solutions to businesses across the globe. We focus on comprehensive assurance, tax, and consulting services for our clients, and we provide our people and our community with the resources to lead meaningful and purposeful lives.
While we are one of the largest California-based accounting firms, our flexible work locations and schedules mean we have professionals across the continent. BPM offers a rich diversity in clients, industries, and overall work. Our teams and our clients drive us to provide quality services and ignite unique insights and ideas that contribute to our continued success.

We are dedicated to providing meaningful careers for all of our employees along with fostering an environment that allows an integrated lifestyle. Our flexible culture allows our professionals to live a balanced lifestyle between their work responsibilities and personal commitments.

Position Overview:

You’re a Human Resources professional looking to use your experience to add value to a variety of interesting clients while maintaining a perfect work-life balance. (Really, we mean it!) You have worked a 9-5, endured lengthy commutes and you are ready for your career to look and feel differently but aren’t sure if that opportunity really exists. (Hint: IT DOES!)

Your natural communication approach is one that effectively, respectfully, and inclusively builds a sense of belonging among employees who differ from one another. You are a strategic thinker and are proactive problem solver and you are able to find ways to cohesively support employees and business drivers.

When you’re considering a new job, it’s normal to have a ton of questions. Here are a few things we get asked all of the time:
If I am working part-time, can I still be eligible for benefits?

YES! BPM employees who work a minimum of 20 hours a week are eligible for paid holidays, PTO, health insurance benefits, and more!
I am tired of the daily grind of a commute, where are you located?

With the exception of scheduled client visits in San Francisco and video meetings, you get to work in the comfort of your own home in your PJs if you’d like! (This is part of that work-life balance we were talking about!) While this is a remote role, if you are located in San Francisco it is ideal.
What makes BPMs HR Consulting team so special?

The people! Each of us come from different backgrounds and bring different experiences to the table. You aren’t expected to know it all because we all are a collaborative team of HR professionals that are here to support each other as we support our clients.

Atomic Semi is building a small, fast semiconductor fab.
It’s already possible to build this with today’s technology and a few simplifications. We’ll build the tools ourselves so we can quickly iterate and improve.
We’re building a small team of exceptional, hands-on engineers to make this happen. Mechanical, electrical, hardware, computer, and process. We’ll own the stack from atoms to architecture. Our team is optimistic about the future and we want to continue pushing the limits of technology.
Smaller is better. Faster is better. Building it ourselves is better.
We believe our team and lab can build anything. We’ve set up 3D printers, a wide array of microscopes, e-beam writers, general fabrication equipment - and whatever is missing, we’ll just invent along the way.
Atomic was founded by Sam Zeloof and Jim Keller. Sam is best known for making chips in his garage, and Jim has been a leader in the semiconductor industry for the past 40 years.
Don’t see the right role for you?
We are always looking to meet exceptional people. Our product is “full-stack” and spans several engineering disciplines. Here’s a non-exhaustive list of what we’re working on:
Mechanical systems (high precision mechanical design, control systems, fluids, temperature & vibration control, optics)
Electrical systems (RF, high voltage, FPGAs)
Software (firmware, low-latency controls, data analysis, robotics and automation)
Nanofabrication (process engineering, chemistry, device physics, transistor modeling)
We’re moving really fast and our needs are changing fast. If you think you can help us build something great, let’s chat!"
